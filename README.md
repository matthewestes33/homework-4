## Features

The user is provided with an initial start button to begin quiz.

Upon starting quiz, the user is presented with the first question in a timed game.

After answering a question, the user is presented with another question, until the last question in the quiz is completed.

To enhance gameplay, incorrect answers incur a time penalty.

When all questions are answered, or when time expires, the game concludes. 

When the game concludes, the user is prompted to save their initials.

The user's initials and the user's score (corresponding to the number of seconds remaining on the clock at the conclusion of the game) are saved in the user browser's local storage.

Upon saving their initials, the user's score is displayed next to their initials.
